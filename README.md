### Extract Proprietary Blobs
* Extract your first proprietary blobs (vendor tree) from a firmware dump using Github Action.

### Steps
* Fork this repository.
* Then, go to repository Settings > Secrets ans Variables > Action > New repository secret; in name - `PAT` and in secret - paste your `Personal Access Token`.
* Go back to Action > All workflows > Extract Blobs > Run workflows > Fill everythin up > Run.

### Notes
* You can get your `Personal Access Token` in account Settings > Developer settings > Personal acccess token.
* Please make sure that you already trimmed your proprietary-files.txt files in your device tree, so you won't explicitly add blobs that weren't actually necessary.
